Rust has a pretty good approach to handling this. There is a bit of learning curve. But if you skip it for any reason, or don’t understand it quite well, then it’ll be difficult for you to write good rust code. 

It’s the ownership model. That keeps us safe and lets us sleep at night after we deploy we rust code to production. This is also how rust avoids a garbage collector.

Lets get started, 

### The Stack
> In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: * Push, which adds an element to the collection, and * Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. - WikiPedia

So, a stack, the idea is to say have objects on top of another. When we add an object, we add it to the top. And when we remove anything from it, we also do it from the top. 

### The Stack Frame
Our code, in terms of execution, think that it is loaded in the stack. So, for rust, we start from the main function. We put our main function on the stack. 

How to put it…? Imagine our stack frame is a sheet of paper. And the function body is on the sheet of paper. 

And imagine our processor is a person, who reads the current sheet of paper in-front of him, and does what’s instructed.

The current stackframe is also, in other words the `scope`.

### When a function is called
When a function is called, that is when we actually put our sheet of paper on top of our stack. Lets take a look at the following code,

```rust

fn main() {
  println!("Hello, World");
	
  let x = 10;
	println("{}", x);
	
	print_another_variable();
}

fn print_another_variable() {
	let k = 11;
	println!("{}",k)
}
```

Our first stackframe is the `main()` function body. It writes Hello, World, then assigns the value 10 to x, then prints it. Then calls another function `print_another_variable()`. 

`print_another_variable()` is written in another sheet of paper. When we call it in our main function, we put  `print_another_variable()` sheet on top of our `main()` sheet. 

Now our processor person is reading from what to do from the function write in front of him. Our processor person can only see (access) the page right in front of him. Not the pages beneath.  
 
After the function has been completed, the sheet of paper is torn apart. And we back to the line this function was called from, and move forward.

> Stack is very fast. 

Now, when we put something on the stack, we need to tell it how much memory we need. For an `i32`  for example, the size is know. It’s a 32 bit signed integer. 

If we try to remember, the maximum value for an integer is 2147483647. If we try to put anything beyond that, it’ll overflow. But the key point is we know the bits. 32 bits fixed. Putting something bigger won’t make it 33 bits. It’ll always be 32 bits.  

### Size Unknown
Putting stuff on the stack works fine when the size is known. But what about the times we don’t know the size? For example a slice or vector? Or a string (not a _char_) .

Let’s think for a moment, we want to store dynamic values. Where the value can grow or shrink. Take an array. Array’s has a fixed length. An array[5] can hold 5 elements at max. 

But a vector can grow, you can start with 5 elements, end up having N where N is <, = or > than 5. We can not ask our stack to give us unlimited space. 

For these problems, let’s add a layer in between.  We don’t directly put the growable data in to the stack, we put our growable dynamic data somewhere else. And, we put a pointer, which’s size is known, we put the point to our stack.

### Heap
Our heap is not as fast and efficient as our stack, but it gives us support for handling dynamic content like strings or vectors.

Putting our growable dynamic data _somewhere else_. This _somewhere else_ is our heap. 

Lets take a look at the code below,

```rust

fn main() {
	let a = String::from("Hello, World");
}
```
For this piece of code, we tell the heap to store “Hello, World” string into memory. It checks how much space does it need based on what we have currently. We have 12 characters (comma and space included). 

The heap takes say memory address 0xAB0001 (lets assume), and starts putting our string. Imagine the sequence goes on like this 0xAB0001, 0xAB0002 … 0xABN. 

Our hello world string ends at 0xAB0012. But what do we store in our stack? Our stack holds the following values, 

```txt
ptr = 0xAB0001 # a pointer to our first memory address
cap = 12 # cap stands for capacity 
len = 12 # len stands for length
``` 
If we update the string to _Hello_, our capacity still remain 12, but our length will be 5. 

And we know the size of the pointer variable itself. If we break down capacity and length, we know their value too.

So we have a solution. Let’s take a look at the 3 rules of ownership rust tells us about.

### 3 Rules of Ownership
1. Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its *owner*.
2. There can only be one owner at a time.
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

### Copy & Pointer
Lets take this example for a moment

```rust

let x = 100;
let y = x;
```

This will trigger a _COPY_. Copy of the value _100_. Cause x in this case is an integer, or in other words, a known sized variable. Same for other known sized. It’s cheap and fast to copy them around.

But, for the following code,

```rust

let a = String::from("Hello");
let b = a ;
```

So, like before, _a_ should be a pointer to the heap memory, holding the data “Hello”.  If so, now when we assign _b_, if it copies the pointer like we would do for an integer or known sized data type, then our “Hello” would have two owners.

### 2 Owners & Double Free Error
For our analogy mentioned above, _Hello_ has two owners. But if one changes, there isn’t any way for the other one to know that something has changed. 

Maybe for _a_ we have changed it to “Hello, Universe, this is from the Milky Way galaxy.”, the capacity and length both has changed. 
But for _b_, it doesn’t know yet! **The pointers get out of sync.**

Now when it’s time to clean up the memory, both owners _a_ and _b_ tries to clear the memory. That will trigger error, cause say _a_ clears the memory at first, and then (imagine), even if it is the  very next step _b_ tries to clear the memory.

But it has already been cleared! 

Let’s think of another scenario, our capacity was 12.  Now we assign a very long string, and make the length (and capacity) of the string 500. 

These are 500 characters of single _char_s. They need to sit next to one another. Just like an array. Remember array takes a fixed memory, so all the elements sits next to another according to the sequence?

Now, the CPU sees that there isn’t 500 free blocks of memory from that 0xAB0001. Meaning, we would need from 0xAB0001 to 0xAB0500 continuous. 

Seeing that the space is not available, it reassigns the value to a next memory address. Maybe 0xQQ0001 to OxQQ0500. 

But for _b_, there is no way to know that the string *ptr -> should not longer point to 0xAB0001. Resulting in garbage value.

### Rust’s solution
So for rust, when assigning `let b = a` where a is a string or of unknown sized data type, it triggers a `move` instead of `copy`. 
Meaning, the pointer information that was stored in a, is not stored in b, and a doesn’t have that information.

If we run the following program, it’ll cause an error, saying
`move occurs because ``a`` has type ``String``, which does not implement the ``Copy```.

```rust

let a = String::from("Hello");
    
println!("{}",a);
    
let b = a;
    
println!("b = {}",b);
println!("a = {}",a);
```

It tells us the `a` or the content (not the value, the pointer information), has been moved. There for when we write `println!(“{}”,a)` at the very last, it doesn’t know what to print.

### Copying the unknown sized data
If we wanted to copy the actual value “Hello” to be, we need to do a `Clone` instead like `let b = a.clone()`.
And take a moment to realise that these solutions abide by the rules of ownership. 

### Rule 3 - Out of scopes
Take a look at the following,

```rust

fn main() {
	let a = String::from("Hello");

	print_something(a);

	println!("a in main => {}", a);
}

fn print_something(a : String) {
	println!("inside the function => {}", a);
}
```

Function params behave in a similar way. In this `print_something()` function, we pass in an argument `a : String` . See the function does not return anything.

So, the variable’s pointer information is passed to that function’s a parameter. Just like `let b = a` example mentioned above. Also, remember that functions are like a sheet of paper? So when the call ends, it’s torn apart. 

In rust’s words, the value is dropped. 

What happens here? This program will throw an error. Once the ownership of `a` has been passed to `print_something`, and `print_something` has been executed, it goes out of scope.
And as the function doesn’t return anything, all the value inside it is dropped.

Therefore, in the main function, we don’t have any value for _a_. We gave the ownership away. Now running `println!("a in main => {}", a);` after calling `print_something()` will trigger an error. 

But if we called the `print_something()` function after `println`, then it would not be a problem cause during `println`, the _a_ variable still holds the information.

### Returning the ownership
Another way to solve it is to return a value from the function. Take the following code and it will run just fine.

```rust

fn main() {

	// added `mut` here
	let mut a = String::from("Hello");
  
	a = print_something(a);
	
	println!("a in main => {}", a);

}
// Notice the " -> String", it means it is gonna return a string
fn print_something(a : String) -> String {
	println!("inside the function => {}", a);
	
	a // here we are returning a string value
}
```

We needed to add `mut` because rust’s variables are by default immutable. But the key point here is in `a = print_something(a)`, we are getting back a string from the `print_something()` function.

### Borrowing | Passing the reference
Another solution would be to pass the reference. Take the following example

```rust

fn main() {
	let a = String::from("Hello");

  // we are passing a reference, denoted by '&'
	print_something(&a);
	
	println!("a in main => {}", a);
}

// see I've added '&' before String
fn print_something(a : &String) {
	println!("inside the function => {}", a);
}
```
This also runs well. 

### Single mutable borrow at a time
Rust allows single mutable borrow at a time. You can have multiple _immutable_ or _read only_ borrows. But you can not have

```rust

let mut a = String::from("a");

let b = &mut a;
let c = &mut a;
```

It’ll throw an error.  Going back to the same problem, imagine _b_ changes some data but _c_ doesn’t know about it. 

### Ownership, Read only borrow , Mutable borrow and Returning ownership
You can tell what a function do. 
```
fn a_func(takes_ownership: String, read_only_borrow: &str, mutable_borrow: &mut String){}

// add '-> String' before the first curly brace if you want it to return some ownership.
```

### Footnote
Why write this article? Because, when I started reading the rust book I thought it might be simply like some other language. Some string functions to lowercase and uppercase and finding length or concatenating. 

**I was wrong.** 

Rust book gave me a very good tour of the stack and heap mechanism. It was a nice reminder but a lot to take in. Specially coming from PHP, JavaScript. 

And soon after, though I continued to read the book, I had forgotten about the ownership and borrowing. 

So I thought  I write it down, after looking at some videos and reading the chapter again.
