For more than 23 years I have been living in a concrete jungle. Building after building its vertical see the sky so narrow. But now suddenly after moving to Berlin,  things have changed. The first thing I noticed that the sky seem to be very big. At first it didn’t make sense to me why would it?

Anyways, 
There were times   I would wait for the moon and sometimes I would get a glimpse of it but suddenly there is a building in front of it and it’s gone for  the night.

For some reason the moon always attracted me and I don’t know why. Do you know that the word lunatic might have came from the moon. Well, not from the moon but if you search how did the word lunatic originate, You will find an answer from quora.com.  
I’m quoting from one of the top voted answers.

"Superstitious believe in mediaeval Europe was the changes in the moonphase could cause madness or insanity in certain people does the swing mentally unstable behaviour, particularly those deemed violent in nature, were branded as afflicted by the moon, moonsick are lunatic from Latin Luna for moon)."

While I do not know if this is valid but we have seen something similar in real life so maybe it is real. 

Whether it’s real or not, watching the full moon always changing something for me. I can look at the moon for hours and hours till  It was hidden behind the building or outside. 

While I don’t like flying, I even booked a ticket to come here on a formal night so I could see the moon. But that didn’t happen.

But finally the day has come when I can really see the full moon with my own eyes. It is beautiful.

My little camera really doesn’t to justice to the beauty. It is what it is it is very beautiful when you see it with your own eyes. And also the good thing is I can see it from my own room, from my own bed and this is what it looks like

To me it’s a blessing. I really love the softness of the Moonlight. And this, only reminded me of the verse from the [https://quran.com/93/5/](Quran, chapter 93 verse 5)

“and surely your Lord will give you so much do you get when you will be pleased”
